A group of people wearing black shades and suits barge into your laboratory. A man steps forward and addresses you.

<img src="res/img/suits.png" width="256" height="256">
<span class="red">"I'm sorry, <span class="textshadow">Harlowe</span>, but given the high cost and relative lack of success of your research, the Illuminati has decided to stop your funding."</span>

You spin around and try to reason with them.

<span class="green">"Wait, I'm so close! Just give me another week, and I'll show you my latest work! It's my magnum opus! Better than anything you've seen before!"</span>

The man in black simply shakes his head.

You vow to have your revenge on the Illuminati for snubbing you and your research.

You are a monster researcher with the knowledge to monsterize humans and improve their combat capabilities.

Without the support of the Illuminati, you do not have access to any test subjects and must perform the experiment on yourself.

A Megamind is THE mastermind. Other masterminds look at you and tear out their hair in envy (not jealousy, because there's no way they could ever be as smart as you).

  Float like a butterfly, sting like a bee. Hands can't hit what the eyes can't see.

  At least you will be faster, somehow.

Ok, you're done. The picking and choosing phase, that is.

Here's a review of what you picked:

You are a <<print player.class>>-based monster.

During your monsterization, you introduced a flaw into your DNA, which gave you <<print player.flaw>>.

Before becoming a monster, you were a <<print fameMap.get(player.fame)>>.

Upon completing your monsterization, you gained the the following abilities:
<span class="yellow">
  <<for _i to 0; _i lt player.abilities.length; _i++>>
    <<print abilityMap.get(player.abilities[_i])>>
  <</for>>

:: Enemy Encounter {"position":"100,2600"}
You meet a <<print window.currentEnemy.name>> sent by the <<print window.currentEnemy.org>> to eliminate you!

<span class="yellow">Combat Explanation:</span>

In combat, you have 3 types of attacks: Light, Normal, and Heavy.

Light attacks have the highest accuracy, but the least damage.
Heavy attacks have the highest damage, but the least accuracy.
Normal attacks have decent accuracy and damage.

Each turn, both you and your enemy will lose some stamina due to stamina drain.
Stamina drain is unavoidable, but can be mitigated by certain abilities specific to some classes.

Get ready to fight!
